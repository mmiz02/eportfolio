## Collaborative Discussion 1

# Aim: Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by [Huxley et al (2020)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/databases/guide/big-data-architectures), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.

I created my initial post after reading the article referenced below and reviewing
other literature in conjunction. My main learning outcomes were to identify
challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities in data wrangling,
which I feel I managed to mention. My initial discussion outlined the key features of
IoT, its opportunities for sectors like transportation and healthcare, and the
challenges related to large-scale data collection, data heterogeneity, and security
risks (Dychok, 2023). I explored data wrangling practices required to transform ra IoT data into
usable insights, including discovery, cleaning, merging, enriching, validating, and
publishing (Applebaum & Fudge, 2024), I also highlighted the importance of automated pipelines and machine-
learning techniques in managing high-volume, real-time data (Halilcevic, 2024).

I received three peer responses, which expanded on my initial discussion to include
important considerations such as data privacy, GDPR compliance, zero-trust security
models, and emerging practices like edge computing. These interactions
encouraged me to think more critically about balancing technical solutions with legal
and ethical obligations.

## What I Learned:
Through this exercise, I developed a deeper undersanding of the complexities
involved in IoT data management. I recognised that data wrangling is not just a
technical process but is also influenced by regulatory, ethical, and organisational
factors. I learned the importance of addressing privacy, consent, and secure data
handling alongside data quality. 

The peer discussions helped me think critically about
practical solutions which I had not fully considered before, such as edge computing.

## Skills developed:
- Critical analysis of IoT data management challenges and opportunities
- Data wrangling methodologies when applied to heterogenous, real-time datasets
- Better awareness of cybersecurity and privacy compliance considerations
- Academic communication

This discussion allowed me to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical
challenges in IoT analytics. Engaging with peers broadened my understanding of
how emerging technologies must balance innovation with responsibility.
