# Collaborative Discussion 2

## Aim: Compare the rules of the GDPR - particularly regarding the securing of personal data with similar compliance laws in the UK, focusing on the ICO's "Security" principle and associated standards and exemptions.

For this discussion, I explored the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its UK counterpart, UK GDPR under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA), following Brexit. my initial post examined how both frameworks uphold the same foundational principles of data integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. I noted that while the GDPR established a strong legal framework, the ICO offers a more practical approach, including encryption, access control, staff training, and audit processes to maintain compliance (European Union, 2016).

I also outlined several differences between the GDPR and UK GDPR, including changes to cnsent requirements and simplified scientific research provisions. Initially, I stated that fines under UK GDPR were capped at £500,000, but a peer correctly pointed out that the current framework allows fines of up to £17.7 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is larger. This aligns the UK's penalties with the EU GDPR (Penalties, 2024). This clarification was crucial in improving the accuracy of my understanding of enforcement.

I received one detailed peer response which provided this valuable clarification. My peer also suggested exploring the practical impacts of DUAA changes, such as how the new "not materially lower" standard for international data transfers could simplify data movement for UK organisations (Annear et al., 2025).

Although I submitted my initial post later than my peers and only received one response, the interaction helped me clarify this subject further. Had I contributed earlier and if more students had participated, I likely would have receievd more feedback and developed a more comprehensive understanding of how these changes affect organisations of varying sizes and data practices.

## Things I learned:
I developed a deeper understanding of how the GDPr and UK GDPR frameworks continue to evolve whilem aintaining core data protection principles. I learned how the ICO's risk-based approach helps organisations translate legal requirements intro practical security measures. Additionally, I recognised the importance of timing and engagement in collaborative learning.

## Skills developed
- Critical comparison of EU and UK data protection frameworks.
- Academic writing
- Reflective and collaborative learning and discussion skills
