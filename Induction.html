## Collaborative Discussion 1 

# Aim: Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by [Huxley et al (2020)] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/databases/guide/big-data-architectures), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.

I created my initial post after reading the article by Huxley et al (2020) and reviewing other literature in conjunction. My main learning outcomes were to identify challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities in data wrangling, which I feel I managed to mention. My initial discussion outlined the key features of IoT, its opportunities for sectors like transportation and healthcare, and the challenges related to large-scale data collection, data heterogeneity, and security risks. I explored data wrangling practices required to transform ra IoT data into usable insights, including discovery, cleaning, merging, enriching, validating, and publishing, I also highlighted the importance of automated pipelines and machine-learning techniques in managing high-volume, real-time data.

I received three peer responses, which expanded on my initial discussion to include important considerations such as data privacy, GDPR compliance, zero-trust security models, and emerging practices like edge computing. These interactions encouraged me to think more critically about balancing technical solutions with legal and ethical obligations.

# What I Learned:

Through this eercise, I developed a deeper undersanding of the complexities involved in IoT data management. I recognised that data wrangling is not just a technical process but is also influenced by regulatory, ethical, and organisational factors. I learned the importance of addressing privacy, consent, and secure data handling alongside data quality. the peer discussions helped me think critically about practical solutions which I had not fully considered before, such as edge computing.

# Skills developed:

- Critical analysis of IoT data management challenges and opportunities
- Data wrangling methodologies when applied to heterogenous, real-time datasets
- Better awareness of cybersecurity and privacy compliance considerations
- Academic communication

# Reflection

This discussion allowed me to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical challenges in IoT analytics. Engaging with peers broadened my understanding of how emerging technologies must balance innovation with responsibility.
