# Web Scraping Project - Data Scientists Job Listings

Using Python's 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' modules, I performed web scraping to extract job listings for the keyword **Data Scientist**. The scraped data was saved in JSON format.

## Steps Taken
1. Used robots.txt to ascertain whether I could even scrape the website legally. After checking various websites, I decided to use the Real Python fake jobs page.
2. Sent an HTTP request

## Steps Taken
1. Sent an HTTP request to the target website using `requests`.
2. Parsed HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
3. Extracted relevant data fields (job titles, companies, locations).
4. Saved the results into a JSON file for later analysis.

## Learning Outcomes Demonstrated
- **IT and Digital Skills:** Using Python libraries and understanding web protocols.
- **Problem Solving & Critical Thinking:** Extracted structured data from semi-structured HTML.
- **Numeracy & Data Handling:** Processed and stored extracted data in JSON format.

## Reflections
- This exercise taught me how to parse and extract relevant data from web pages.
- I gained practical experience with `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and JSON.
- A challenge was handling different HTML structures; I overcame it by inspecting elements carefully using browser developer tools.

## Artefacts
