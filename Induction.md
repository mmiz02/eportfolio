## Collaborative Discussion 1 

## The aim of the discussion was to critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of the article by [Huxley et al (2020)] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/databases/guide/big-data-architectures), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.

# I created my initial post after reading the article by Huxley et al (2020) and reviewing other literature in conjunction. My main learning outcomes were to identify challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities in data wrangling, which I feel I managed to mention.

## Initial Post

# The Internet of Things (IoT) represents an architecture made of billions of connected devices which generate large-scale real-time data (What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?, 2024). It offers vast opportunities such as transportation and traffic management to  reduce congestion and pollution (Dychok, 2023).

Leveraging such data requires robust data wrangling practices to transform messy, raw data into a clean, usable format for analysis (Applebaum & Fudge, 2024). Since IoT data comes from various sources, data heterogeneity is an issue which complicates integration and analysis. Data collection in itself is also challenging as edge devices may have limited connectivity. This could increase gaps and data errors, along with measurement noise which need to be addressed prior to data being analysed. Additionally, they generate huge volumes of data, leading to big data and the need for increased computational and storage costs. This highlights the importance of data wrangling to maintain analytical accuracy(Applebaum & Fudge, 2024).

Therefore, stricter data wrangling methodologies need to be adopted, starting from data collection, a crucial step for IoT devices. The data needs to be discovered by studying its characteristics, after which it must be structured.  Afterwards, data is cleaned and merged (to create one dataset from a variety of readings). It is then enriched by deriving newer, more informative data from it. Validation is done throughout, and then the data is published (Applebaum & Fudge, 2024).

Having a robust, automated data pipeline which adapts when unexpected data comes through is a must. Depending on the devices, SQL, Python and C are used and if large volumes of data in the cloud need to be handled, Apache Spark is used. Also, machine learning can be used to fill in missing data or detect anomalies (Applebaum & Fudge, 2024).

Another challenge of IoT is security. If one device is breached, this could easily open access to a myriad of other devices (Dychok, 2023). Some risks include the lack of encryption in many devices, inconsistent security standards, and gaps between the mobile network and cloud, where transmissions between these two may leave the devices vulnerable to malware (Henke, 2023). To address these issues, encrypting messages and sending them over private networks instead of public ones is a step in the right direction.

In conclusion, the IoT holds potential across many sectors but demands effective data wrangling practices and robust security practices.

Your post highlights the large-scale data that is generated by the internet of things (IoT) and eloquently describes the steps and challenges that are associated with processing and storing this data in a manner that optimises accuracy and thereby enables utilisation for future analysis.  You also touch on concerns regarding cybersecurity and current risks that result from lack of properly encrypted data and inconsistency between platforms and security standards.   

It would be of interest to expand on the potential issues regarding not just cyber security, but specifically data privacy and how relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR are met.  IoT devices generate and process vast amounts of personal data; how are the GDPR principles such as data minimisation balanced alongside the drive to collect data for future analysis, and how do we ensure appropriate accuracy and limitation of use related to personal data? Brighton (2023) argues that the development and growth of IoT far outpaces development of privacy protection regulations.  Robust cyber security is vital to protect personal data from potential breaches by cybercriminals, however beyond this, additional concerns regarding compliance to data protection legislations remain (Peach, 2022)

Your post opens with a clear definition of IoT as a massive, real-time data ecosystem and grounds the benefits with a concrete public-value example (traffic and congestion). You then draw a straight line from opportunity to the practical work i.e. data wrangling. The way you unpack heterogeneity, intermittent connectivity, noise and sheer volume shows why raw data rarely arrive “analysis-ready.” The lifecycle you outline (discover > structure > clean/merge > enrich > validate > publish) signals a sound grasp of preparation and pipelines.

Sonya’s follow-on adds what many technical overviews miss: privacy. Her question - how principles like data minimisation, purpose limitation and accuracy are applied in practice - rightly reframes quality as both a legal and methodological duty. That dovetails with Huxley et al.’s view that cleaning and transparent reporting (what was flagged, fixed or excluded) are part of the accountable method, and with Unit 1’s practical routines (cleansing, standardisation, formatting, normalisation) that make review and audit feasible.

You rightly concentrate on security - weak/missing encryption, inconsistent standards and gaps between network layers - while Sonya surfaces privacy (what to collect, why, and for how long). Keeping a clear line between them helps: security keeps intruders out; privacy ensures lawful, proportionate use. Encryption won’t decide whether a field should be collected or retained. Treating information as an organisational asset - with ownership, access and retention rules - rounds out the argument (Ohlhorst, 2012).

I agree with your point that data wrangling forms the backbone of IoT analytics. Without consistent, high-quality data, even the most advanced machine learning models or big data platforms would produce unreliable insights. Automation in wrangling workflows is especially crucial, given the scale and speed of IoT data generation. For example, self-healing pipelines that can flag anomalies, retrain models, or switch to backup data sources can ensure higher resilience in real-time environments (Halilcevic, 2024).

Regarding security, you rightly mention encryption and private networks. In addition to that, adopting a “zero-trust” model, where every device, user, or application must be verified before gaining access, could help mitigate the cascading risks of a single-device breach (Olubudo, 2023). Another emerging approach is edge computing, where more processing is done closer to the devices themselves. This not only reduces latency and bandwidth needs but can also limit sensitive data exposure to the cloud (Oladimeji et al., 2023).

In short, IoT success depends on balancing data quality with system security. Both must evolve in tandem, since poor-quality data is as damaging as a data breach when it comes to decision-making.

## After going through my peer's responses, I summarised my  initial post:

## Summary post

My initial post on the Internet of Things (IoT) highlighted both the transformative potential and the complexities associated with large-scale data collection and management. IoT represents an ecosystem of interconnected devices generating real-time, heterogenous data, providing opportunities for innovation across sectors such as transportation and healthcare (Dychok, 2023).

Initially, I emphasised the importance of strict data wrangling methodologies for heterogeneous data coming from IoT devices, starting off from data collection, a stage not usually included in this process. However, in such cases, missing and erroneous data may start emerging and exponentially increasing, leading to anomalies and high cost. This step is followed by discovery, structuring, cleaning, merging, enriching, validating, and publishing, to ensure the data is ready for analysis (Applebaum & Fudge, 2024). Automated pipelines and machine learning techniques are critical for handling the high volume, velocity, and variety of IoT data. This idea was reinforced by my peer’s mention of self-healing pipelines which flag anomalies and retrain models to ensure data quality is maintained in real-time environments (Halilcevic, 2024).

My discussion also included security challenges. Peer feedback expanded on this by including privacy and regulatory considerations. While security measures like encryption mitigate cyberattacks risks, IoT also raises concerns about personal data protection and GDPR compliance (in Europe) (Brighton, 2023; Peach, 2022). Not only are data minimisation, purpose limitation, and accuracy, essential principles of privacy and compliance, another key issue is obtaining consent for the processing of such data, especially in the case of minors (GDPR and internet of things (IOT), 2025). Information has to have clearly defined ownership, access, and retention policies (Ohlhorst, 2012)

Further insights from peers emphasise emerging practices like zero-trust security and edge computing to enhance resilience and reduce data exposure (Olubudo, 2023; Oladimeji et al., 2023).

To conclude, the success of IoT initiatives relies on a balance between effective data wrangling, strong cybersecurity, and robust privacy practices, bearing compliance in mind.
